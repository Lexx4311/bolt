Bolt is an easy to use CMS endowed with the flexibility and power of Kohana 3. 

**Administrators** will love it because it's very easy to use like WordPress or Joomla. 
**Site Builders** will love it because it's modular, many aspects are inspired by Drupal.
**Developers** will love it because it's just Kohana 3.x with a CMS module. 
**Designers** will love it because its theming system is just simple HTML and PHP just like Joomla's.

Excited? Sorry, it's just 5% done.
